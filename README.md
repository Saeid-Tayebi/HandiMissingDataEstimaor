# Handy Missing Data Estimator

This repository contains a simple yet effective tool for **estimating missing data** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. It has been designed to work seamlessly with both Python and MATLAB, providing a robust way to handle missing data in various datasets.

## Overview

The tool is intended for estimating missing values in datasets with incomplete rows. Using only the complete data, it constructs a PCA model and leverages the principal components to estimate missing values in each row. This approach allows for handling missing data effectively by leveraging the correlations within the available data.

### Key Features:
- **Data Imputation with PCA**: Estimates missing values using a PCA model trained on the complete rows in the dataset.
- **Support for Both Python and MATLAB**: The tool includes separate files for Python and MATLAB implementations, making it easy to integrate into projects in either language.
- **User-Friendly Data Integration**: Example data blocks are provided, and users can modify them according to their specific data needs.

### How It Works

1. Provide a block of data with missing values.
2. The code trains a PCA model on the complete rows in the dataset.
3. This PCA model is used to estimate missing values for each row, based on the relationships learned from the complete data.

### Example Usage

Both Python and MATLAB implementations of the tool are included in this repository. You can replace the example data with your own dataset to estimate missing values.

#### Python

1. Prepare an array with missing values (e.g., `IncompletData`).
2. Use the `pca_missing_data_estimator` function:

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    # Replace with your own data
    IncompletData = np.array([
        # your data here
    ])

    # Estimating missing values
    estimated_block = pca_missing_data_estimator(IncompletData)
    print(estimated_block)
    ```

#### MATLAB

1. Prepare a matrix with missing values (e.g., `incompleteData`).
2. Use the `pca_missing_data_estimator` function:

    ```matlab
    % Replace with your own data
    incompleteData = [
        % your data here
    ];

    % Estimating missing values
    estimatedBlock = pca_missing_data_estimator(incompleteData);
    disp(estimatedBlock)
    ```

### Running the Code

1. Download the appropriate file (`missingDataEstimatorator.py` for Python or `missingDataEstimator.m` for MATLAB).
2. Replace the example data with your own dataset.
3. Run the code to estimate missing values.

This tool offers a practical and straightforward approach to handling missing data using PCA, with the flexibility to be applied across various datasets in both Python and MATLAB environments.
